A video and audio chat application built with WebRTC + NodeJS

You can try it here: <a href="captochat.herokuapp.com">Chat</a>

Ok you should know that the queueing system was garbage and the whole thing is slightly buggy lol.
Every time two people visit the site, it just pairs you up with the last person who joins
I was going to use socket.io and use it's "grouping" feature but I got bored of this app. :/
